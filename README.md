# Design

## Colour Scheme

The scheme for the website uses an array of colours to portait the vibrancy of these colours in all the different fruits avaliable to us. The grey scale background gives the website a more 'modern feel' with bursts of colour highlighting different areas.<br>
When moving from page to page, pops of colour help to show the user an icon or link they maybe hovering over, aswell as helping to highlight the current page the user is browsing.<br>

## Typography

The text styles used are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), they are installed by a link in the <em>'Head'</em> of the <em>'index.html'</em> page.<br>
Donegal One - This font held the colour grey very well. It looked agreeable in different grey scale tones and remained professional against the more elaborate Google Font of Delicious Handrawn.<br>
Sans Serif - Used for clear business standard text and is very readable. Placed incase a user finds the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) chosen, not to work on their platform.<br>
Delicious Handrawn - The name of the font sounded appealing to use to help emphaise text describing the fruits. It is also used at different points on the website to just add contrast to the Donegal One font.<br>
<br>

## Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for icons throughout this project. They help portait different style faces including big grins for the Home page, encouraging winks for the sign up page and well known icons, for the well known social platform links.
